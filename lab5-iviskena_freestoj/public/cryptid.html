                <h2>Clear Evidence for Cryptids on Campus</h2>
                <p>
                    Few individuals are yet aware, but Bigfoot has maintained a presence on
                    campus for nearly one year. This page aims to shed some light on the truth
                    of the situation, in the hopes that some of the cryptid-deniers might recognize
                    the error of their ways.

                <p>A yeti was spotted going for a stroll by Acopian on an autumn day:</p>

                <p>Footprints (too large and disruptive to be human) were spotted this winter in the patio by RISC:</p>

                <p>
                    We are also aware of 9 CCTV images of Cryptid recorded on campus 
                    since 2018! Additionally, PSAFE has received 31 official complaints related to unidentified "very big hairy creatures"
                    walking on campus since the last semester! Even though 9 of these complaints turned out to be about Efe, the camera evidence 
                    still supports the fact that we have actual cryptids
